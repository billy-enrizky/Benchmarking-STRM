# Preprocessing UCF101 Dataset

UCF101 is an action recognition dataset of realistic action videos, collected from YouTube, having 101 action categories. This dataset is an extension of the UCF50 dataset which has 50 action categories.

With 13,320 videos from 101 action categories, UCF101 offers the largest diversity in terms of actions and, with the presence of large variations in camera motion, object appearance and pose, object scale, viewpoint, cluttered background, illumination conditions, etc., it is the most challenging dataset to date. As most of the available action recognition datasets are not realistic and are staged by actors, UCF101 aims to encourage further research into action recognition by learning and exploring new realistic action categories.

The videos in 101 action categories are grouped into 25 groups, where each group can consist of 4-7 videos of an action. The videos from the same group may share some common features, such as similar background, similar viewpoint, etc.

The action categories can be divided into five types:
1. Human-Object Interaction
2. Body-Motion Only
3. Human-Human Interaction
4. Playing Musical Instruments
5. Sports

The action categories for the UCF101 dataset are:

## Steps to Preprocess the UCF101 Dataset

1. Download the dataset from [UCF101 Dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) or use the following command to download it:
   ```bash
   wget https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101/UCF101.rar
   ```

2. The downloaded file will be `UCF101.rar`.

3. Install `unrar` using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install unrar
   ```

4. Create a directory for the dataset and extract the contents of the `UCF101.rar` file:
   ```bash
   mkdir ucf101_dataset
   unrar x UCF101.rar ucf101_dataset
   ```
5. Install FFmpeg by running the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
   ```

6. Run the `extract_ucf.py` script to get the train-test split and extract frames for each video:
   ```bash
   python extract_ucf.py
   ```
   This will create a folder called `ucf_256x256q5`, where `256` is the height and the width output.

7. Zip the folder that has been split into train and test sets and contains the extracted frames:
   ```bash
   zip -r ucf_256x256q5.zip ucf_256x256q5
   ```
```
